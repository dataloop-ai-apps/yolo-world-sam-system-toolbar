# System Studio Tool Bar

This app will install a system scope toolbar with yolo-world and SAM.

## Features
In the main Image Studio, we will have a button to run on the entire item:
1. Run Yolo-world using the item's labels
2. Get SAM features from the global SAM service
3. Run the SAM decoder locally (ONNX) to generate masks from the yolo boxes
